# Strings

***Declaration***

```
var firstName = "Mert";
var lastName = "Karayel";
```

***Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings***

When your string is "Challengers said, "Mert is learning JavaScript"." How do you define that ?

```
var sentence = "Challengers said, \"Mert is learning JavaScript.\"."
```

When you need a literal quote on your string, you can easily escape from quote by using backslash(\) in front of the quote. 

Another way to do that is changing outer double quote to single quote and thats it so we can easily read this notation. The other way is not easy on the eye for long post so  this way is much better.

```
var sentence = 'Challengers said, "Mert is learning JavaScript.".'
```

***Escape Sequences in Strings***

*  \\'  single quote 
* \\"  double quote 
* \\\\ backslash 
* \n newline 
* \r carriage return 
* \t tab 
* \b backspace 
* \f   feed

***Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator***

When the + operator is used with a String value, it is called the concatenation operator.

```
var str = "My name is Mert." + " I am blogging."
```

Also I can write it like this.

```
var str = "My name is Mert.";
str += "I am blogging."
```

***Find the Length of a String***

```
"Mert Karayel".length; // 12
```

***Use Bracket Notation to Find the First Character in a String***

```
var name = "Mert Karayel"
var firstLetterOfName = name[0] // M
```

# Array

We can store several pieces of data in one place with using array.

```
var myInfo = ["Mert Karayel", "22",""Software Engineering"];
```

***Multi Dimensional Array***

```
var userInfo = [["Mert Karayel", "22",""Software Engineering"],["James Gosling","61","Java"]];
```

***Access Array Data***  

```
var myArray = [1,2,3,4,5];
var data = array[1];  // equals 2 Basically arrayName[index]
```

***Access Multi Dimensional Array Data***

```
var myArray = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9], [[10,11,12], 13, 14]];
var myData = myArray[2][1]; // 8
```

***Manipulate Arrays With push***

```
var arr = [1,2,3];
arr.push(4); // new array 1,2,3,4
```

***Manipulate Arrays With pop***

pop() always removes the last element of an array. 

```
var arr = [1,2,3];
arr.pop(); // 3
```

***Manipulate Arrays With shift***

push() always removes the first element of an array. 

```
var arr = [1,2,3];
arr.shift(); // 1
```

***Manipulate Arrays With unshift***

```
var myArray = [["John", 23], ["dog", 3]];
myArray.shift(); // ["dog",3]
myArray.unshift(["Paul",35]); // ["Paul",35],["dog",3]
```


***Iterate over Arrays with map***

The map method will iterate through every element of the array, creating a new array with values that have been modified by the callback function, and return it. Note that it does not modify the original array.

```
var oldArray = [1,2,3,4,5];
var newArray = oldArray.map(function(value){
  return value+3;
});
console.log(oldArray); // [1,2,3,4,5]
console.log(newArray); // [4,5,6,7,8]
```

***Condense arrays with reduce***

The array method reduce is used to iterate through an array and condense it into one value.

reduce has an optional second argument which can be used to set the initial value of the accumulator. If no initial value is specified it will be the first array element and currentVal will start with the second array element.

```
var array = [4,5,6,7,8];
var singleVal = 0;
singleVal = array.reduce(function(previousVal,currentVal){
  return previousVal + currentVal;
},0); // 30
```

***Filter Arrays with filter***

The filter method is used to iterate through an array and filter out elements where a given condition is not true.

```
var oldArray = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];
var newArray = oldArray.filter(function(value){
  return value < 6;
}); // [1,2,3,4,5]
```

***Sort Arrays with sort***

You can use the method sort to easily sort the values in an array alphabetically or numerically.

```
var array = [1, 12, 21, 2];
array.sort(function(a,b){
  return b > a;
}); // [21,12,2,1]
```

***Reverse Arrays with reverse***

You can use the reverse method to reverse the elements of an array.

```
var array = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7];
var newArray = [];
newArray = array.reverse(); // [7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
```

***Concatenate Arrays with concat***

concat can be used to merge the contents of two arrays into one.

```
var oldArray = [1,2,3];
var newArray = [];
var concatMe = [4,5,6];
newArray = oldArray.concat(concatMe); // [1,2,3,4,5,6]
```

***Split Strings with split***

You can use the split method to split a string into an array.

```
var string = "Split me into an array";
var array = [];
array = string.split(" "); // [Split,me,into,an,array]
```

***Join Strings with join***

You can use the join method to join each element of an array into a string separated by whatever delimiter you provide as an argument.

```
var joinMe = ["Split","me","into","an","array"];
var joinedString = '';
joinedString = joinMe.join(" "); // Split me into an array
```

# Comparision

***Comparison with the Strict Equality Operator***

Strict equality (===) is the counterpart to the equality operator (==). Unlike the equality operator, strict equality tests both the data type and value of the compared elements.

```
3 === 3   // true
3 === '3' // false
```

***Comparison with the Strict Inequality Operator***

The strict inequality operator (!==) is the opposite of the strict equality operator. It means "Strictly Not Equal" and returns false where strict equality would return true and vice versa. Strict inequality will not convert data types.

```
3 !== 3   // false
3 !== '3' // true
4 !== 3   // true
```

# Functions 

***Write Reusable JavaScript with Functions***

Example function 

```
function functionName() {
  console.log("Hello World");
}
```

You can invoke this function by using its name.

functionName();

***Passing Values to Functions with Arguments***

Example function

```
function functionWithParameter(param1, param2) {
  console.log(param1, param2);
}
```

Then we can call functionWithParameter:

```
functionWithParameter("Hello", "World");
```

***Global Scope***

Variables which are defined outside of a function block have Global scope.This means, they can be seen everywhere in your JavaScript code.Variables which are used without the var keyword are automatically created in the global scope. 

***Local Scope***

Variables which are declared within a function, as well as the function parameters have local scope. That means, they are only visible within that function.

***Return a Value from a Function with Return***

```
function plusThree(num) {
  return num + 3;
}

var answer = plusThree(5); // 8
```

# Objects 

***Creating Object*** 

Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through what are called properties.

```
var cat = {
  "name": "Whiskers",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "enemies": ["Water", "Dogs"]
};
```

***How can I reach the javascript object properties ?***

This is simple as much as you think. If you know any other programming language, . (dot) provide to access object properties.

```
cat.name // Whiskers
```


Javascript have more option about that problem. You can access object properties with using bracket notation. This notation is as simple as dot notation.

```
var myName = {
  "First Name": "Mert",
  "Las Name": "Karayel"
};

myName["First Name"]; // Mert
```

If you want to update your object properties.You just use dot or bracket notation for properties and assign another value.
```
var myName = {
  "First Name": "Mert",
  "Las Name": "Karayel"
};

myName["First Name"]; // Mert

myName["First Name"]="Marry";
```

***Add New Properties to Object***

We can add new properties to objects the same way we would modify them.

```
myName["age"] = 22;
```

***Delete Properties from Object***

We can also delete properties from objects like this:

```
delete myName.age;
```

***Using Objects for Lookups***

Objects can be thought of as a key/value storage, like a dictionary. If you have tabular data, you can use an object to "lookup" values rather than a switch statement or an if/else chain. This is most useful when you know that your input data is limited to a certain range.

Here is an example of a simple reverse alphabet lookup:

```
var alpha = {
  1:"Z",
  2:"Y",
  3:"X",
  4:"W",
  ...
  24:"C",
  25:"B",
  26:"A"
};
alpha[2]; // "Y"
alpha[24]; // "C"
```

***Testing Objects for Properties***
We can use the .hasOwnProperty(propname) method of objects to determine if that object has the given property name. .hasOwnProperty() returns true or false if the property is found or not.

```
myName.hasOwnProperty("First Name"); // true
```

***Manipulating Complex Objects***

Here's an example of a complex data structure:

```
var ourMusic = [
  {
    "artist": "Daft Punk",
    "title": "Homework",
    "release_year": 1997,
    "formats": [ 
      "CD", 
      "Cassette", 
      "LP" ],
    "gold": true
  }
];
```

This is an array which contains one object inside. The object has various pieces of metadata about an album. 

***Accessing Nested  Objects***

```
var ourStorage = {
  "desk": {
    "drawer": "stapler"
  },
  "cabinet": {
    "top drawer": { 
      "folder1": "a file",
      "folder2": "secrets"
    },
    "bottom drawer": "soda"
  }
};

ourStorage.cabiner["top drawer"].folder1; //a file
```

# Object Oriented Programming 

***Constructor***

```
var Car = function() {
  this.wheels = 4;
  this.engines = 1;
  this.seats = 5;
};
```

***Make Unique Objects by Passing Parameters to our Constructor***

```
var Car = function(wheels, seats, engines) {
  this.wheels = wheels;
  this.seats = seats;
  this.engines = engines;
};

var myCar = new Car(6, 3, 1);
```
